<h1>Landon Swavey acts in a play</h1>

<h3>An Enemy of the People Act 4 (Ibsen)</h3>

<h3 class="name">Hovstad.<h/3> <p class="speech hovstad">"I lay no claim to any sort of distinction, 
I am the son of humble country-folk, and I am proud that the stock
 I come from is rooted deep among the common people he insults.</p>

<h3 class="name">Voices.</h3> <p class="speech voices">Bravo, Hovstad! Bravo! Bravo!</p>

<h3 class="name">Dr. Stockmann.</h3> <p class="speech drstockmann">The kind of common people I mean are not only to be found 
low down in the social scale; 
they crawl and swarm all around us--even in the highest social positions. 
You have only to look at your own fine, distinguished Mayor! 
My brother Peter is every bit as plebeian as anyone that 
walks in two shoes-- <p class="direction">[laughter and hisses]</p>

<h3 class="name">Peter Stockmann.</h3> <p class="speech peterstockmann">I protest against personal allusions of this kind.</p>

<h3 class="name">Dr. Stockmann.</h3> <p class="direction">[imperturbably]</p> <p class="speech drstockmann">.--and that, not because he is like myself, 
descended from some old rascal of a pirate from Pomerania or thereabouts--
because that is who we are descended from--</p>

<h3 class="name">Peter Stockmann.</h3> <p class="speech peterstockmann">An absurd legend. I deny it!<p>

<h3 class="name">Dr. Stockmann.</h3> <p class="speech drstockmann">--but because he thinks what his superiors think, 
and holds the same opinions as they, People who do that are, 
intellectually speaking, common people; and, that is why my magnificent
 brother Peter is in reality so very far from any distinction--a
 nd consequently also so far from being liberal- minded."</p>
