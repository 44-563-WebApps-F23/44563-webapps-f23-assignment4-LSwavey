        <h3 class="name">Peter Stockmann</h3> <p class="speech peterstockmann">Mr. Chairman--!</p>

        <h3 class="name">Hovstad</h3> <p class="speech Hovstad">So it is only the distinguished men that are liberal- 
            minded in this country? We are learning something quite new! <p class="direction">[Laughter.]</p>

        <h3 class="name">Dr. Stockmann</h3> <p class="speech drstockmann">Yes, that is part of my new discovery too. 
            And another part of it is that broad-mindedness is almost precisely
             the same thing as morality. That is why I maintain that it is absolutely inexcusable in the
              "People's Messenger" to proclaim, day in and day out, the false doctrine that it is the masses,
               the crowd, the compact majority, that have the monopoly of broad- mindedness and morality--and 
               that vice and corruption and every kind of intellectual depravity are the result of culture, 
               just as all the filth that is draining into our Baths is the result of the tanneries up at Molledal! 
               <p class="direction">(Uproar and interruptions. DR. STOCKMANN is undisturbed, and goes on, carried away by his ardour, with a smile.)</p>
                <p class="speech drstockmann">And yet this same "People's Messenger" can go on preaching that the masses ought to be 
               elevated to higher conditions of life! But, bless my soul, if the "Messenger's" teaching 
               is to be depended upon, this very raising up the masses would mean nothing more or less than 
               setting them straightway upon the paths of depravity! Happily the theory that culture demoralises 
               is only an old falsehood that our forefathers believed in and we have inherited. No, it is ignorance, 
               poverty, ugly conditions of life, that do the devil's work! In a house which does not get aired and swept 
               every day--my wife Katherine maintains that the floor ought to be scrubbed as well, but that is a 
               debatable question--in such a house, let me tell you, people will lose within two or three years 
               the power of thinking or acting in a moral manner. Lack of oxygen weakens the conscience. 
               And there must be a plentiful lack of oxygen in very many houses in this town, I should think,
                judging from the fact that the whole compact majority can be unconscientious enough to wish to build the 
                town's prosperity on a quagmire of falsehood and deceit.</p>
